The main purpose of this project is to provide free online consultation for the patients. If the patient is a new user, they will have to register. In the patient form, we can collect the patient's informations. Then, they make an appointment by selecting the populated list of available doctors which, in turn, lists the upcoming appointments for the selected doctor.
